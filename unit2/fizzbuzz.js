// FizzBuzz is a popular programming problem. 

// This program currently runs through the first 30 integers and prints them.

// Change the program to print out the integers using the following rules instead:

// 1. If the number is divisible by 3, print out 'Fizz' instead of the number.
// 2. If the number is divisible by 5, print out 'Buzz' instead of the number.
// 3. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print out 'FizzBuzz' instead of the number.
// 4. Otherwise, print the number.

for (i=1; i <= 30; i++) {
  console.log(i);
